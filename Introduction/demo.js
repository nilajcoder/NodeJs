1. What is a server (backend)?
A server is a computer or system that provides resources, data, services,
 or programs to other computers, known as clients, over a network.
  It handles requests from clients, processes them, and sends back the appropriate responses.

  A server (backend) is where data is processed, stored, and sent to the front-end when requested.

  

What is a client (frontend)?
A client is a computer or software that requests services, resources,
 or data from a server over a network. It interacts with the server by sending
  requests and receiving responses, typically through a web browser, application, or other interface.

A client (frontend) is the part of a web application that users interact with,
 displaying data from the server and handling user inputs.
  


CLI vs. GUI
CLI (Command-Line Interface) and GUI (Graphical User Interface) are two different ways of interacting with a computer or software.

What is CLI?

Definition: A text-based interface where users type commands to perform tasks.

How It Works: You interact with the system by typing specific commands into a terminal or console.

Examples: Command Prompt in Windows, Terminal in macOS or Linux.

What is GUI?

Definition: A visual interface where users interact with the system through graphical elements like windows, icons, buttons, and menus.

How It Works: Users perform tasks by clicking, dragging, and dropping using a mouse or touchpad.

Examples: Windows OS, macOS, Ubuntu Desktop.
  

what is node.js?
Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that is used to run the JavaScript code outside the browser.
It is used to build the server-side applications.


echo

Purpose: Displays a line of text or variables.
Example: echo "Hello World" → Outputs: Hello World.

pwd

Purpose: Prints the current working directory.
Example: If you're in /home/user, running pwd outputs /home/user.

ls

Purpose: Lists files and directories in the current directory.
Example: ls → Lists all files and folders.

ls -la

Purpose: Lists files and directories, including hidden ones, with detailed information.
Example: ls -la → Outputs file permissions, ownership, size, and modification date.

cd

Purpose: Changes the current directory.
Example: cd /home/user/Documents → Navigates to the Documents folder.


cat

Purpose: Displays the content of a file.
Example: cat file.txt → Shows the content of file.txt.


nano

Purpose: Opens a simple text editor in the terminal.
Example: nano file.txt → Opens file.txt for editing.


vim

Purpose: Opens a powerful text editor in the terminal.
Example: vim file.txt → Opens file.txt for editing.


touch

Purpose: Creates a new, empty file or updates the timestamp of an existing file.
Example: touch newfile.txt → Creates newfile.txt.


mkdir

Purpose: Creates a new directory.
Example: mkdir new_folder → Creates a folder named new_folder.


cp

Purpose: Copies files or directories.
Example: cp source.txt destination.txt → Copies source.txt to destination.txt.


mv

Purpose: Moves or renames files and directories.
Example: mv oldname.txt newname.txt → Renames oldname.txt to newname.txt.


rm

Purpose: Removes (deletes) files or directories.
Example: rm file.txt → Deletes file.txt.
Use rm -r to remove directories and their contents recursively.


rmdir

Purpose: Removes empty directories.
Example: rmdir empty_folder → Deletes the empty_folder.



The rm -r command in Linux is used to recursively delete directories and their contents, including files and subdirectories. Here's a detailed explanation:

Usage of rm -r
Command:

bash
Copy code
rm -r directory_name
Deletes the specified directory (directory_name) and all of its contents, including subdirectories.
Example:
Suppose you have a directory structure like this:

markdown
Copy code
test_directory/
├── file1.txt
├── file2.txt
└── sub_directory/
    └── file3.txt
Running:

bash
Copy code
rm -r test_directory
will delete test_directory, file1.txt, file2.txt, and the sub_directory along with its contents.

Options:

-f (force): Use rm -rf to delete without confirmation prompts.
bash
Copy code
rm -rf directory_name
This is especially useful in scripts but must be used cautiously to avoid accidental data loss.

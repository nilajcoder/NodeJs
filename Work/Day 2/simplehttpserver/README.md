### 1Ô∏è‚É£ What is the purpose of this project?
‚Üí To create a simple Node.js HTTP server that serves different file types based on route requests.

npm init 

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Which Node.js core modules are used in this project?

http ‚Äî To create the HTTP server

fs ‚Äî To read files from the filesystem

path ‚Äî To handle file paths

url ‚Äî To resolve URL paths (via fileURLToPath and dirname)

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ What routes are handled by this server?

/about ‚Äî Returns about.html as an HTML page

/contact ‚Äî Returns contact.html as an HTML page

/image ‚Äî Returns image.jpg as an image file

/pdf ‚Äî Returns pdf.pdf as a PDF file

Any other route ‚Äî Returns a JSON response (default)

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ What are the MIME types used in the server responses?

text/html ‚Äî For HTML pages

image/jpg ‚Äî For image files

application/pdf ‚Äî For PDF files

application/json ‚Äî For JSON responses

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ On which port does the server run?
‚Üí Port 8000

http://localhost:8000/contact
http://localhost:8000/about
http://localhost:8000/pdf
http://localhost:8000/image
http://localhost:8000


### 6Ô∏è‚É£ How to start the server?


node index.js
### 7Ô∏è‚É£ What should be the folder structure?

/project-root
 ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ files/
 ‚îÇ    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ about.html
 ‚îÇ    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ contact.html
 ‚îÇ    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ image.jpg
 ‚îÇ    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ pdf.pdf
 ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ index.js
### 8Ô∏è‚É£ What happens if the requested file is missing?
‚Üí Currently, the server will throw an error if a file is missing.
(Optional enhancement: add error handling for missing files.)

### 9Ô∏è‚É£ Is this server production-ready?
‚Üí No, this is for learning/demo purposes. For production, use Express.js with proper error handling and security middleware.

### 10Ô∏è How can this project be extended?

Serve other file types like CSV, JSON, CSS, JS

Add dynamic routing

Use Express.js for cleaner routing

Add content-type detection dynamically

## 11 What is the role of fileURLToPath(import.meta.url) in this project?
‚Üí It converts the module URL into a local file path, so we can get the correct __filename in ES Modules.

## 12Ô∏è Why do we use dirname(__filename)?
‚Üí To get the absolute directory path of the current file, since __dirname is not available in ES Modules by default.

## 13Ô∏è What will happen if a user requests an undefined route?
‚Üí The server responds with a JSON message:

{
  "data": "This is home page"
}

## 14Ô∏è What is the difference between fs.readFileSync() and fs.readFile()?
‚Üí fs.readFileSync() is blocking (synchronous) ‚Äî the server waits until the file is read.
‚Üí fs.readFile() is non-blocking (asynchronous) ‚Äî preferred for production servers.

## 15 Why is the Content-Type header important in HTTP responses?
‚Üí It tells the browser how to handle the response data (e.g., render HTML, display image, download PDF).

## 16Ô∏è What happens if you remove res.writeHead() from the response?
‚Üí The browser may not interpret the file correctly because the content type is missing.

## 17 What is the default behavior of http.createServer() callback function?
‚Üí It executes for every incoming request with req (request) and res (response) objects.

## 18Ô∏è What is the role of res.end() in Node.js HTTP server?
‚Üí It signals the end of the HTTP response. Without it, the client will keep waiting.

## 19Ô∏è Why is this called a 'local server'?
‚Üí Because it's running on your machine (localhost:8000), not deployed on the internet.

## 20Ô∏è How would you make this server handle asynchronous file reading?


fs.readFile(filePath, (err, data) => {
  if (err) {
    res.writeHead(404);
    res.end('File not found');
  } else {
    res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': '...' });
    res.end(data);
  }
});

### 21 How would you deploy this server for public access?
‚Üí Use a hosting provider (e.g., Heroku, Render, Railway) and open the correct port with public access.

## 22Ô∏è What are some limitations of this HTTP server?

No dynamic routing

No error handling for missing files

Synchronous blocking I/O

No middleware or security features

## 23Ô∏è What is the difference between this and using Express.js?
‚Üí Express.js simplifies routing, adds middleware support,
 handles errors better, and provides more flexibility for production apps.

## 24Ô∏è How would you handle large files like videos or big PDFs?
‚Üí Use streams with fs.createReadStream() instead of fs.readFileSync()

## 25Ô∏è What would be a good enhancement for file serving?

Use MIME type detection libraries (like mime-types)

Implement logging middleware

Serve files asynchronously with streams

Add error handling



### Node.js Watch Mode Example
üìù Description
This project demonstrates how to run a Node.js script in watch mode, which automatically restarts the app when files change.
Useful for development and testing purposes.

### package.json type-module 
node --watch index.js
